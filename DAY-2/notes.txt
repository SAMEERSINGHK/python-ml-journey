Day 2 Learnings:

- Used if, elif, and else for decision making
- Practiced match-case for menu-based logic
- Used for loops with range() for sequences and patterns
- Used while loops for repeated input and validation
- Learned break, continue, and pass statements
- Created calculator, password checker, and number-based programs

Doubts / Improvements:
- When to prefer match-case over if-elif
- Best use cases for pass in real projects
