Day 3 Learnings:

- Used string indexing and slicing
- Practiced common string methods like strip(), title(), count(), find(), and replace()
- Used format() and f-strings for string formatting
- Built vowel counter using for loop and condition
- Created palindrome checker using slicing

Doubts / Improvements:
- Difference between find() and index()
- Performance of slicing vs loops for string reversal
